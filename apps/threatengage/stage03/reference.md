# Stage 03 – Reference Configuration

This configuration represents the final experimental stage (**Stage 3**) of the dissertation.

- Objective: Evaluate performance under dynamic threats and active invader behavior.
- Scenario:
  - Two loyal wingmen (pursuers)
  - Multiple loitering munitions (invaders) with movement and attack logic
- Additional elements:
  - Explosive behavior of invaders (proximity-based)
  - Cooldown logic, engagement range constraints
- Multiple experimental variants were tested, including:
  - Reward shaping
  - Behavioral pruning
  - Timed attack windows

⚠️ This stage included exploratory experiments beyond the static parameters of Stages 1 and 2.
