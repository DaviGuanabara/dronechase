# Gimbals

## Description

The `Gimbals` component simulates a series of servo actuated gimbals.
This is useful for redirecting the thrust from the `Motors` or `Boosters` components.

This component represents rotation about two different, arbitrary axes on a link, represented as `gimbal_unit_1` and `gimbal_unit_2`.
Rotation follows the right handed rotation rule.
