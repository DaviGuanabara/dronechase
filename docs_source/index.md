# Description

PyFlyt is a library for testing reinforcement learning algorithms on UAVs.

It is built on the [Bullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) physics engine, offers flexible rendering options,
time-discrete steppable physics, Python bindings, and support for custom drones of any configuration, be it biplanes, quadcopters, rockets, and anything you can think of.
