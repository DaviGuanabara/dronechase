Methodology: Choosing Sparse Reward in Reinforcement Learning

In the development of our reinforcement learning model, specifically designed for an aerial combat simulation within a Master's program project, we elected to employ a sparse reward structure. This decision was influenced by several key considerations, aligned with our objectives and expectations:

Simplicity and Interpretability: Sparse rewards offer a straightforward and easily interpretable framework. By providing clear and distinct signals only when significant events occur (such as eliminating an enemy or failing a defense objective), the model is encouraged to focus on these key outcomes. This simplicity aids in debugging and understanding the model's learning process, which is crucial for academic research.

Alignment with Key Objectives: The primary objectives in our simulation are twofold - engaging enemy aircraft and defending a specified area. A sparse reward system directly aligns with these objectives by rewarding the agent for successful engagements and penalizing for failures in defense. This ensures that the agent's learning is closely tied to the desired operational outcomes.

Avoidance of Unintended Behavior: Complex or densely populated reward structures can sometimes lead to unintended learning behaviors, where the agent optimizes for the reward in unforeseen ways that do not necessarily align with the intended goals. Sparse rewards minimize this risk by providing a clear and direct incentive structure.

Facilitating Long-Term Strategic Learning: In contrast to dense reward structures that can encourage short-term gains, sparse rewards necessitate and promote long-term strategic planning by the agent. The agent must learn to balance the risk and reward over a longer horizon, particularly in scenarios involving multiple waves of enemy engagements and the ongoing need to protect a designated area.

Enhanced Challenge and Skill Acquisition: Employing sparse rewards increases the challenge for the agent, compelling it to develop more sophisticated strategies and behaviors to achieve success. This aligns with the educational goals of a Master's program, where the emphasis is on overcoming complex challenges and advancing the state of knowledge and capability in AI and machine learning.

Empirical Basis for Reward Structure: Our decision is also grounded in empirical findings. Experiences and experiments have shown that, particularly in complex simulation environments, simpler reward structures often yield more consistent and understandable results. Therefore, the choice of a sparse reward system is supported by both theoretical considerations and practical outcomes.

Expectations and Evaluation Criteria: With a sparse reward structure, we expect the agent to develop a balanced approach to offense and defense, prioritizing key objectives without being distracted by less significant actions. Our evaluation criteria, including the number of enemies engaged, survival time, and successful defense of the area, are tailored to measure the effectiveness of this approach.

In the context of the reinforcement learning model employed for the aerial combat simulation, we have established a reward structure that is both sparse and strategically aligned with the key objectives of the simulation. This structure is designed to encourage the desired behaviors in the agent, specifically tailored to the challenges of aerial combat scenarios. The reward structure is as follows:

Engagement Reward: The agent receives a reward for each enemy aircraft it successfully engages and eliminates. This component of the reward structure directly incentivizes the primary operational goal of the simulation – aggressive and effective engagement of enemy aircraft. The magnitude of this reward is set to reflect the importance of this objective, ensuring that the agent prioritizes enemy engagement.

Penalty for Negative Outcomes: To balance the engagement reward and to ensure the agent is also focused on survival and defense, penalties are incorporated for specific negative outcomes:

Agent Death Penalty: A significant penalty is applied if the agent is destroyed or killed. This penalty is crucial to encourage the agent to avoid reckless behavior that would jeopardize its survival.
Protected Area Breach Penalty: Another substantial penalty is imposed if the agent fails to defend the protected area, and it is successfully attacked by enemy forces. This aspect of the reward structure emphasizes the importance of the defensive component of the mission, ensuring that the agent maintains a balance between offense and defense.
Episode Termination Criteria: The simulation episode concludes under two conditions, reflecting critical failure states in the operational context:

If the agent is destroyed or killed.
If the protected area is successfully attacked by enemy forces.
Sparse Nature of Rewards: Reflecting our methodological choice, this reward structure is intentionally sparse. The agent is only rewarded or penalized for significant events directly related to the core objectives of the simulation. This sparsity is designed to promote clarity in the learning process, enabling the agent to focus on these key events and develop strategies that are effectively aligned with the operational goals.

Objectives of the Aerial Combat Simulation

Effective Engagement of Enemy Aircraft: A primary objective of the simulation is to train and evaluate the agent's ability to effectively engage and eliminate enemy aircraft. This involves developing strategies for identifying, targeting, and successfully engaging enemy units in various combat scenarios.

Defense of a Designated Area: In addition to offensive capabilities, the agent is tasked with defending a specific area or asset within the simulation environment. This objective requires the agent to balance offensive actions with strategic positioning and movement to protect the designated area from enemy attacks.

Adaptation to Increasing Threat Levels: The simulation is designed to present the agent with progressively challenging scenarios, typically involving waves of enemy forces with increasing difficulty. The agent must adapt its strategies to handle multiple threats simultaneously and effectively manage resources like ammunition and energy.

Survival and Resource Management: A critical aspect of the simulation is the agent's ability to survive throughout the engagement. This includes managing its health or durability and effectively using limited resources, such as ammunition, to maximize its effectiveness over time.

Strategic Decision-Making: The agent is expected to develop and demonstrate strategic decision-making skills. This involves choosing when to engage or evade enemy units, how to position itself relative to the enemy and the protected area, and when to prioritize defense over offense.

Learning and Adaptation Over Time: The simulation aims to assess the agent's ability to learn and improve over time. Through exposure to various combat scenarios and outcomes, the agent is expected to refine its strategies, demonstrating an increased proficiency in both offensive engagements and defensive tactics.

Performance Under Constraints: The agent must operate under specific constraints, such as limited visibility, restricted movement areas, or rules of engagement, which add complexity to the simulation and require more nuanced strategies.

Generalization of Skills: Lastly, an important objective is to evaluate the agent's ability to generalize learned skills across different scenarios. This tests the flexibility and robustness of the agent’s learning, ensuring that it can adapt its strategies to new and unforeseen situations within the aerial combat environment.
