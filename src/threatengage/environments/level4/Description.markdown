Level 4 is the level that i reached the aimed designed. Of course it has a lot more things to improve, but thats is enough to make the experiments and extract some data. 

The first experiment is a 1 loyalwingman trying to defend against the loitering munition invasion. The loyalwingman has 10 munitions, and the loitering munition is attaking in waves, incremented by 1. So, first wave is 1 loitering munition, second wave is 2 loitering munitions, and so on. The loyalwingman has to destroy all the loitering munitions to win the game. (In total, it gets 4 waves)
